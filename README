This code provides a simple C interface to the Roomba Serial Command Interface
(http://www.irobot.com/images/consumer/hacker/Roomba_SCI_Spec_Manual.pdf)

Documentation and build scripts coming soon, but for now most functions seem to work on recent Linux systems (and probably most other *NIX systems).

The serial cable needed to use the SCI can be built based on the spec, or  purchased from either iRobot or a number of other online electronics shops.

Note that this is not in any way affiliated with or authorized by iRobot inc.

Happy Cleaning!
